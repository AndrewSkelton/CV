description: Statistical analysis is a core aspect of my current role, as such I've become highly capable of taking high level concepts and applying them to very large datasets. An example of which is with a recent eQTL study I analysed, where the PI wanted a bespoke analysis, and standard packages couldn't offer a solution. An eQTL analysis involves looking for a trend in expression, based on a patient's genotype to identify disease traits. The bespoke analysis involved running a simple linear regression, over hundreds of thousands of combinations, and evolved to implementing a Multinomial Log-linear Model. This kind of model allowed us to identify disease specific eQTLs. The github project is available in the link below.
